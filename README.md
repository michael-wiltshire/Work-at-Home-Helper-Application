# Work at Home Helper
This system is designed to help learning assistants keep track of their working hours, by allowing them to clock in, clock out, enter standalone times, and edit previously recorded time. The system also allows users to preview and export timesheets.

## Operational Features
The Learning Assistant Time Tracker has three modes of operation:

* Clock in and clock out mode, which allows users to track their working hours automatically.
* Miscellaneous mode, which allows users to enter standalone times and make edits as necessary.
* Spreadsheet preview and creation mode, which allows users to preview and export their timesheets.

## Modes of Operation
* Clock in and clock out mode: 
Users can press a button to clock in when they start working and clock out when they finish. The system automatically saves the time worked.
* Miscellaneous mode:
If the user does not use the clock in and out feature, they can enter the time worked manually and make edits as necessary.
* Spreadsheet preview and creation mode: Users can preview and edit their timesheets before exporting them as a CSV file.
